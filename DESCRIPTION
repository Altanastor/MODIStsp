Description: Allows automating the creation of time series of rasters derived from MODIS Land Products data 
    by performing several typical preprocessing steps such as download, mosaicking, reprojection
    and resize on MODIS data available within a given time period.  All processing parameters can be
    easily selected with a user-friendly GUI. Users have the ability to select which specific layers 
    of the original MODIS HDF files they want to process. They also can select which additional 
    Quality Indicators should be extracted from the aggregated MODIS Quality Assurance layers and, in the
    case of Surface Reflectance products, which Spectral Indexes should be computed from the original reflectance 
    bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as single-band raster files corresponding to the different 
    available acquisition dates. Virtual files allowing access to the entire time series as a single file
    are also created. Command-line execution exploiting a previously saved processing options file is also possible, 
    allowing to  automatically update time series related to a MODIS product whenever a new image is made available.
