Description: MODISTSP, a R package devoted to automating the creation of time
    series of rasters derived from MODIS Land Products data. MODISTSP allows to
    perform several preprocessing steps (e.g., download, mosaicking, reprojection
    and resize) on MODIS data available within a given time period. Users have the
    ability to select which specific layers of the original MODIS HDF files they
    want to process. They also can select which additional Quality Indicators should
    be extracted from the aggregated MODIS Quality Assurance layers and, in the
    case of Surface Reflectance products, which Spectral Indexes should be computed
    from the original reflectance bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved
    as single-band raster files corresponding to the different available acquisition
    dates. Virtual files allowing access to the entire time series as a single file
    are also created. All processing parameters can be easily selected with a user-
    friendly GUI. Command-line execution is also possible, allowing to use MODISTSP
    to automatically update time series related to a MODIS product whenever a new
    image is made available.
