Description: Allows automating the creation of time series of rasters derived 
    from MODIS Land Products data by performing several typical preprocessing 
    steps such as download, mosaicking, reprojection and resize. All processing
    parameters can be set using a user-friendly GUI. Users have the ability to
    select which layers of the original MODIS HDF files they want to process, 
    and which additional Quality Indicators should be extracted from 
    aggregated MODIS Quality Assurance layers and, in the case of Surface 
    Reflectance products, which Spectral Indexes should be computed from the 
    original reflectance bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as 
    single-band raster files corresponding to each available acquisition date.
    Virtual files allowing access to the entire time series as a single file
    are also created. Command-line execution exploiting a previously saved 
    processing options file is also possible, allowing to automatically update 
    time series related to a MODIS product whenever a new image is available.
