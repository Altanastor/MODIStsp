@article{Hall2002,
abstract = {On December 18, 1999, the Terra satellite was launched with a complement of five instruments including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Many geophysical products are derived from MODIS data including global snow-cover products. MODIS snow and ice products have been available through the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) since September 13, 2000. MODIS snow-cover products represent potential improvement to or enhancement of the currently available operational products mainly because the MODIS products are global and 500-m resolution, and have the capability to separate most snow and clouds. The MODIS snow-mapping algorithms are automated, which means that a consistent data set may be generated for long-term climate studies that require snow-cover information. Extensive quality assurance (QA) information is stored with the products. The MODIS snow product suite begins with a 500-m resolution, 2330-km swath snow-cover map, which is then gridded to an integerized sinusoidal grid to produce daily and 8-day composite tile products. The sequence proceeds to a climate-modeling grid (CMG) product at 0.05° resolution, with both daily and 8-day composite products. Each pixel of the daily CMG contains fraction of snow cover from 40\% to 100\%. Measured errors of commission in the CMG are low, for example, on the continent of Australia in the spring, they vary from 0.02\% to 0.10\%. Near-term enhancements include daily snow albedo and fractional snow cover. A case study from March 6, 2000, involving MODIS data and field and aircraft measurements, is presented to show some early validation work.},

abstract = {We evaluated the initial 12 months of vegetation index product availability from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

abstract = {Detection of plant water stress by remote sensing has been proposed using indices of Near-Infrared (NIR, 0.7–1.3 $\mu$m) and Middle-Infrared (MIR, 1.3–2.5 $\mu$m) wavelengths. The first objective of this study was to test the ability of the Leaf Water Content Index (LWCI) to determine leaf Relative Water content (RWC) of different species with different leaf morphologies. The second objective was to determine how the Moisture Stress Index (MSI; MIR / NIR) varies with RWC and the Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). Reflectance factors at 0.82 $\mu$m and 1.6 $\mu$m were measured on leaves of Quercus agrifolia (sclerophyllous leaves), Liquidambar styraciflua (hardwood deciduous tree leaves), Picea rubens and Picea pungens (conifer needles), and Glycine max (herbaceous dicot leaves) as they dried on a laboratory bench. RWC and EWT were measured concurrently with the reflectance measurements. The results showed that LWCI was equal to RWC for the species tested. However, the results of a sensitivity analysis indicated the reflectances at 1.6 $\mu$m for two different RWC must be known for accurate prediction of unknown RWC; thus the LWCI is impractical for field applications. MSI was linearly correlated to RWCwith each species having a different regression equation and to log10 EWT with data of all species falling on the same regression line. Because EWT is correlated with leaf area index, MSI should also be correlated with leaf area index. Assuming that the linear regression equation of MSI to EWT can be applied to canopies, then the minimum significant change of RWC that can be detected is 52\%. For most plants, the natural variation in RWC from water stress is only about 20\%, so that we conclude that indices derived from NIR and MIR reflectances cannot be used to remotely-sense water stress.},

abstract = {In situ collected spectrometer data were used to evaluate and quantify the relationships between various linear combinations of red and photographic infrared radiances and experimental plot biomass, leaf water content, and chlorophyll content. The radiance variables evaluated included the red and photographic infrared (IR) radiance and the linear combinations of the IR/red ratio, the square root of the IR/red ratio, the IR-red difference, the vegetation index, and the transformed vegetation index. In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the IR and red linear combinations vis-\`{a}-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and IR linear combinations had 7\% and 14\% greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6\% difference separated the highest and lowest of these four ER and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic IR radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies.},

abstract = {In Central Asia major alterations in land use and land cover occurred in the past decades due to political collapse of the Soviet Union, human forces, and climate change. In this context accurate land cover information for the region of Central Asia is important. In this study we present a classification approach with implemented C5.0 algorithm addressing regional land cover characteristics of Central Asia. The classification is performed on seasonal features derived from MODIS time-series for the years 2001 and 2009, which allows us to analyse possible land cover and land use changes. Training and validation are based on a reference dataset collected from high resolution remote sensing data. The overall accuracy of both classifications is above 90\%. The results show some significant changes between both years in different land cover classes. Human induced alterations of water bodies, variability in sparsely vegetated areas due to seasonal precipitation and forest loss caused by forest fires and logging are exemplarily depicted and discussed in this study.},

abstract = {The reflectance spectra of higher plant leaves are considered with special reference to remote sensing of chlorophyll concentration. Wavelengths with maximum sensitivity to chlorophyll content were found in the wide spectral range from 530 to 630 nm and near 700 nm. The wavelength of the red edge position of the reflectance spectrum correlated very closely with the reflectance at 550 and 700 nm. The ratios of reflectances in the near infra-red range of the spectrum (above 750 nm) to that at 700 nm RNIRR700 and RNIRR550 were directly proportional to the leaves' chlorophyll concentration. Newly introduced algorithms make it possible chlorophyll estimation with an error of less than 5 nmol/cm2 and could be applied to a number of plant species. They exhibit more than 6 times wider dynamic range than the widely used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. (NDVI).},

Graphically, the transformation involves a shifting of the origin of reflectance spectra plotted in NIR-red wavelength space to account for first-order soil-vegetation interactions and differential red and NIR flux extinction through vegetated canopies. For cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var DPI-70) and range grass (Eragrosticslehmanniana Nees) canopies, underlain with different soil backgrounds, the transformation nearly eliminated soil-induced variations in vegetation indices. A physical basis for the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) is subsequently presented.
